This page contains a collection of notes from my Master of Science in Mathematics and Statistics
at the University of Melbourne, which I expect to compete mid-year 2022. 
My masters thesis is investigating the theory behind deep learning, particularly 
using tools from algebraic geometry.
I began this project at the start of 2021 and it is ongoing.
My supervisor is [Dr Daniel Murfet](http://therisingsea.org) and I am part of the 
[Melbourne Deep Learning Group](https://mdlg.ai). 


## Miscellaneous Notes
- [**Blow-ups**](masters_content/blowups.pdf) (April 2021). This note introduces 
varieties and blowups of varieties, and briefly discusses how these arise in singular 
learning theory.
- [**Neural networks and uniform approximation**](masters_content/nn-approximation.pdf) (March 2021)
This note presents a proof that neural networks can approximate real-valued
functions on a compact space in the sense of the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem.
- [**Background**](masters_content/background.pdf) (March 2021) A brief summary of 
some literature related to my project.
