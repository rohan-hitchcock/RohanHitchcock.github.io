This page contains a collection of notes from my masters project at the University of Melbourne. I began this project at the start of 2021. It is currently ongoing.
My supervisor is [Dr Daniel Murfet](http://therisingsea.org) and I am part of the 
[Melbourne Deep Learning Group](https://mdlg.ai). 


## Miscellaneous Notes
- [**Blow-ups**](masters_content/blowups.pdf) (April 2021). This note introduces 
varieties, blowups of varieties, and briefly discusses how these arise in singular 
learning theory.
- [**Neural networks and uniform approximation**](masters_content/nn-approximation.pdf) (March 2021)
This note presents a proof that neural networks can approximate real-valued
functions on a compact space in the sense of the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem.
- [**Background**](masters_content/background.pdf) (March 2021) A brief summary of 
some literature related to my project.
