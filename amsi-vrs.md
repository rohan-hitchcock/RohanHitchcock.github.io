In the summer of 2019/2020 I completed a six week research project at the 
University of Western Australia under the supervision of Dr John Bamberg and Professor 
Michael Guidici, as part of the Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute's
[Vacation Research Scholarship](https://vrs.amsi.org.au/student-profile/rohan-hitchcock/). 

My project was centred around understanding the paper "Octonions, Albert Vectors 
and the group $$E_6(F)$$" by J. N. Bray, Y. Stepanov and R. A. Wilson (2019) 
[arXiv:1906.08846](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08846). This paper presents an 
alternative construction of the groups of type $$E_6$$ over an arbitrary field 
(i.e. the construction does not use Lie algebras). 

This project resulted in a report 
(which can be read [here](amsi-vrs_content/amsi-vrs-report.pdf)) and a presentation at the AMSI Connect Conference.
